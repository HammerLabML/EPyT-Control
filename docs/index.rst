EPANET Python Toolkit Control -- EPyT-Control
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

EPyT-Control is a Python package building on top of `EPyT-Flow <https://github.com/WaterFutures/EPyT-Flow>`_ 
for implementing and evaluating control algorithms & strategies in water distribution networks
(WDN).

A special focus of this Python package is Reinforcement Learning for data-driven control in WDNs and
therefore it provides full compatibility with the
